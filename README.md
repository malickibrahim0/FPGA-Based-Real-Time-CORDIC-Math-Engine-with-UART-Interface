# FPGA-Based-Real-Time-CORDIC-Math-Engine-with-UART-Interface

This project implements a pipelined CORDIC algorithm in Verilog to calculate sine and cosine values in real-time. It runs on a Lattice iCE40 FPGA and communicates with a PC over UART.  Outputs are validated against a Python model that plots both hardware and software results side by side and calculates percent error. I want to scale this project into something that has to do with Signal Processing
